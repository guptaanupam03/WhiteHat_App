## WhiteHat Programming Challenges for Job Candidates

`ApplianceMonitor` is a Perl Mojolicious project designed to test a candidate's
ability to write Perl code for web applications at all levels.

This is a tough challenge. Feel free to talk to us for clarifications and help.
Also, we encourage you to commit frequently and leave your git history un-squashed.
Seeing how you evolved your final answer gives us vital information about
how you think and solve problems.

Please make sure that you submit your *final* answer. We're going to be doing
an in-depth review of the code you submit, and we will only do this once.

Good luck!
